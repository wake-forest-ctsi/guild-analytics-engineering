Examples of this work would be the population of known data models such as OMOP, i2b2, or PCORI and also the creation of novel data marts to support school of medicine admissions analysis (Splash).</p> <p>Analytics engineers work closely with data analysts and data scientists, building out data models which are generalizable enough to be used to answer specific questions.</p>"},{"location":"charter/#responsibilities","title":"Responsibilities","text":"<pre><code>\u2022 Data modeling: Create data models that are optimized for analysis \n\u2022 Data transformation: Clean, transform, and test data \n\u2022 Data documentation: Maintain documentation related to datasets and analysis \n\u2022 Data deployment: Deploy data models \n\u2022 Data quality: Support data quality improvement \n\u2022 Data communication: Communicate results to stakeholders \n\u2022 Data collaboration: Collaborate with data analysts and other team members\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"charter/#skills-and-background","title":"Skills and background","text":"<pre><code>\u2022 Knowledge of dimensional modeling concepts and techniques\n\u2022 Proficiency in SQL, DBT, and common transformation tools\n\u2022 Knowledge of data infrastructure tools like Snowflake\n\u2022 Knowledge of software engineering practices\n\u2022 Good team-working and interpersonal skills\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"charter/#membership-who","title":"Membership (Who?)","text":"<p>Open to all analytics engineers, data engineers, and adjacent roles interested in contributing to or learning from the community.
