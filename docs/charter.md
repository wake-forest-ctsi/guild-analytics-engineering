## Focus (Why?)
Foster a community of effective analytics engineers at Advocate Health

Analytics engineering is the process of applying engineering principles to data to create clean, usable datasets. Analytics engineers work to ensure that data is accurate, accessible, and ready for analysis. They also work to bridge the gap between business needs and technical data work.  Examples of this work would be the population of known data models such as OMOP, i2b2, or PCORI and also the creation of novel data marts to support school of medicine admissions analysis (Splash).

Analytics engineers work closely with data analysts and data scientists, building out data models which are generalizable enough to be used to answer specific questions.

### Responsibilities  
    • Data modeling: Create data models that are optimized for analysis 
    • Data transformation: Clean, transform, and test data 
    • Data documentation: Maintain documentation related to datasets and analysis 
    • Data deployment: Deploy data models 
    • Data quality: Support data quality improvement 
    • Data communication: Communicate results to stakeholders 
    • Data collaboration: Collaborate with data analysts and other team members 

### Skills and background 
    • Knowledge of dimensional modeling concepts and techniques
    • Proficiency in SQL, DBT, and common transformation tools
    • Knowledge of data infrastructure tools like Snowflake
    • Knowledge of software engineering practices
    • Good team-working and interpersonal skills 
    


## Membership (Who?)

Open to all analytics engineers, data engineers, and adjacent roles interested in contributing to or learning from the community. Participation is voluntary but encouraged.

### Leader 
    • Organizes and promoting regular guild activities or meetings
    • Maintains guild organizing documents and spaces
    • Recruits new members to join the guild and serve in guild roles
    • Participates in Guild of Guilds (GOGO)
    • Regularly evaluates guild effectiveness, engagement, and feedback

### Archivist
    • Maintains a well-organized knowledge repository for anyone in the enterprise to view
    • Keeps meeting notes and to-do's

### Member
    • Attends guild activities
    • Lead discussions and present on topics of interest to the guild
    

## Activities (What?)

The guild will meet regularly to have organized discussions led by guildmembers on topics related to analytics engineering including recent projects, tools, and concepts.

Some example topics for discussion could be:
    Walkthrough: Convene to learn about a project the presenter is responsible for that has analytics engineering aspects
    Tool Training: Members and Guests convene to learn a new tool. Either collaboratively learning or following a guided training by meeting lead.
    Skill Tutorial: Members and Guests convene to learn a new skill. Either collaboratively learning or following a guided training by meeting lead.

Guildmembers will be encouraged to contribute to a repository of best practices, examples, and documentation that can serve as a reference for everyone.


## (Where?)
There is an open [Microsoft Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AFIu16PhqMaQ3YBXu5bwuepQnPh96NIb8uLGCS534FeQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=33b20e96-730b-4d07-b732-7db5d8a7689f&tenantId=3fc2e695-283d-4e4e-ad46-e437d11b18ab) which everyone is encouraged to use to ask questions, share knowledge, and get to know people.

We also have our own [git repo](https://github.com/wake-forest-ctsi/guild-analytics-engineering)!  Most of what we produce, whether that be session summaries or guides, will live in the MAGE's repo.  If you're reading this right now it's probably in the repo. The repo is based on mkdocs and the resulting page is hosted at https://wake-forest-ctsi.github.io/guild-analytics-engineering/.


## (When?)
Monthly hour long meetings organized in Teams and promoted on the CTSI calendar.
