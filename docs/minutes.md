## 5th August 2025 - Guild Kickoff üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Michael introduced the purpose of the guild and reviewed the [charter](./charter.md):
    - **Goal**: Turn our discussions in this guild into documentation about what we should be doing as analytics engineers
	- We have a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wake-forest-ctsi/guild-analytics-engineering) for the guild, which utilizes MkDocs to keep track of guild documentation
	- We have a Teams channel for quick discussions, and can have longer-term discussions in the Discussions tab on the guild's GitHub page
	- Upcoming guild meetings will be in the calendar on the guild's Teams channel
    - Archivist role will act as an editor in organizing guild content and documentation, currently assigned to Irina
- The guild will be referred to as the "Analytics Engineering Guild", but we also have a whimsical name (MAGES) and a fun logo! Any feedback is welcome regarding the name of the guild.
- Anyone is welcome to be a member! Just let Michael know and he'll add you to the guild's Team channel.
- Guild will tentatively continue meeting at 3 PM EST on Tuesdays, but this is not set in stone. Contact Michael if you have any scheduling issues.
- Vote in the poll in the Teams channel on what topics you'd like to discuss
	- If you have any other topic ideas, please add them to the [list of ideas](./schedule.md/#other-topic-ideas)!
- The hope is that people will use the guild's Teams channel to ask questions and connect with peers so we can work together to find solutions
